## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to check the temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii in June and December to see if there is a potential market for an ice cream and surfing shop. In order for this to work, we need to make sure that it is not too cold, which would cause people to not want ice cream or to go surfing.
## Results
. There will likely be a market year around as there are warm temperatures throughout the year. The mean December temperature is 71 degrees while the mean June temperature is 75 degrees
. Despite getting temperatures from different times of year the weather itself is relatively constant, with the summary statistics being similar in both June and December.
. Both months have over 1500 datapoints from a number of different measurement stations, so we can be confident in the accuracy of our statistics.
## Summary
Based on this analysis, Oahu seems to be a high level place to open an ice cream shop as well as a surfboard shop, as the temperature is nearly constant throughout the year. Two more things I would like to perform in addition to the temperature analysis would be precipitation amounts as well as the number of sunny days for each months. This would help to confirm that the weather in Oahu year around is as nice as the temperatures indicate.
